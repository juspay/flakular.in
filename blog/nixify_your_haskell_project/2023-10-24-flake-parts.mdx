# Nixify your haskell project: flake-parts

This is the second part of the series [Nixify your haskell project]. In the previous part, we saw how to use flakes to build a haskell project. In this part, we will understand the module system in Nix and how to leverage its power in flakes given by [flake-parts](https://flake.parts).
