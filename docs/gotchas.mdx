# Gotchas

Nix can behave unexpectedly in certain cases.

## nix-health reports an error {#nix-health}

[nix-health] can report one of the following errors:

[nix-health]: https://github.com/srid/nix-health

### `Multiple versions of nix found in PATH` {#multiple-nix-versions}

You probably have Nix installed in root profile:

```
sudo nix-env -q
```

Remove that,

```
sudo nix-env --uninstall nix
```

## Nix does not recognize a new file I added {#git-untracked}

Often you'll see an error like this,

```
error: getting status of '/nix/store/vlks3d7fr5ywc923pvqacx2bkzm1782j-source/foo': No such file or directory
```

This usually means you have not staged this new file/ directory to the Git
index. When using flakes, Nix will not see untracked files/ directories by default. To resolve this, just `git add -N` the untracked file/ directory.

    - Run `/nix/nix-installer uninstall`
    - If that path above does not exist, [follow these instructions](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415830650265-Uninstall-nix-on-MacOS) to manually unintall Nix.

## Nix's sqlite database is corrupted/broken {#sqlite-corrupted}

If nix throws an error like:

```
error: getting status of '/nix/store/....drv': No such file or directory
```

You can try to fix it by running:

```
nix-store --verify --check-contents --repair
```
