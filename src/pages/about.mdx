# About

**Flakular** aims to supplement [Zero to Nix](https://zero-to-nix.com/) with
the goal of introducing people to writing *modular* flakes.

We begin with explaining the necessary Nix
[foundations](/foundations) before proceeding to highlight the various [flake
modules](/modules) (developed using the [flake-parts](https://flake.parts/)
framework) that are typically involved in managing software
projects and systems.

## Contributing

Documentation for individual modules may live in their respective repositories. We reference them using [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). To modify the documentation for a module, you should:

1. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/juspay/flakular)
2. Run `nix develop` to enter a shell with all the necessary tools
3. Edit one of the `ext/*` folder. For eg., to work on haskell-flake documentation, edit a file under `ext/haskell-flake`
4. Run `just run` in the nix shell to run the website locally.
5. Once you are done with your changes, commit it to the submodule repository, and then commit the submodule change in this repo.
